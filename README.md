A kata a day keeps the imposter syndrome away.

All the projects, exercises and code snippets I've attempted on a "code-gym" website Codewars. Keep in mind stuff uploaded here goes all the way back to the beginning, so the initial exercises are super-basic (e.g. simple one-liners etc), but are included for the sake of completeness. Katas are sorted in ascending order of complexity so for more recent, more complex katas, look at ones starting with a higher number.
