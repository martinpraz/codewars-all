"A kata a day keeps the imposter syndrome away."

All the projects, exercises and code "snippets" I've ever attempted on a "code-gym website" Codewars. Keep in mind this goes way back (and due to the Kata progression system) some of the stuff you'll find here might be super-basic (e.g. simple one-liners etc), but I included all of it nonetheless for the sake of completeness.
