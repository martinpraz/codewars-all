"A kata a day keeps the imposter syndrome away."

All the projects, exercises and code snippets I've attempted on a "code-gym" website Codewars. Keep in mind this goes way back (and due to the Kata progression system) some of the stuff you'll find here might be super-basic (e.g. simple one-liners etc), but is included nevertheless for the sake of completeness. Individual katas are indexed in ascending order (kata 1 is the oldest kata, the kata with the highest number is the most recent one).
